# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📘 Project Overview
This Power BI project visualizes **Electric Vehicle (EV) data** across the United States, providing actionable insights into **vehicle distribution, manufacturer trends, CAFV eligibility, and average electric range**.  
The dashboard enables users to explore data dynamically through filters for **city, utility, and vehicle type**, helping identify growth trends and regional adoption patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **total EV registrations** by make, model, and state.  
- Compare adoption rates of **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**.  
- Evaluate **CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle)** eligibility impact.  
- Identify top-performing **EV manufacturers and models**.  
- Visualize growth trends of EVs over the years.
